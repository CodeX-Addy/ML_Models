# ML_Models
This repo contains various models such as ML models which are a great tool to help predict future events. There are an increasing number of real-world tasks, decisions, and objects that can be represented mathematically as repeatable, step-by-step processes or pixel-by-pixel images, and then converted into code that a machine can act on.
